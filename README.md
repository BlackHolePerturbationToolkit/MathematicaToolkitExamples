# Mathematica Toolkit Examples

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks that give examples of how to use various packages and data in the Toolkit. Example notebooks include:


| Notebook name                         | description																										
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KerrGeodesics							| Demonstrates functions that are part of the KerrGeodesics package													   |
| Kerr_quasi-circular_flux_inspiral.nb  | Use the energy flux data and the KerrGeodesics package to compute a quasi-circular inspiral into a Kerr black hole   |
| High_spin_fluxes.nb					| Compute radiated energy flux from a particle in the near-horizon regime of a near-extremal Kerr black hole		   |
